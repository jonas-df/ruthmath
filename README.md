# Ruth's multiplication app

Me and my daughter had fun writing a simple python app for her to practice the multiplication tables.

# How to run
Simply clone the repo and run the script.py file

Access the app locally through your browser using the IP-address logged in the terminal.

Since it's using Flask it is also easily deployable on something like https://pythonanywhere.com
